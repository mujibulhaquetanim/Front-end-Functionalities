## Introduction

This repository houses a variety of frontend components, each designed to solve specific problems. Here's how the repository is structured:

1. **Individual Projects**:
   - Each individual project has its own directory within this repository.
   - These projects are self-contained and can be used independently.
   - Examples: `photo-upload`, `quiz-app`, `redux-todo`.

2. **Feature Projects**:
   - Smaller individual projects related to specific features are grouped together in a separate directory called `feature-project`.
   - These feature projects may include multiple components that work together.
   - Examples: `news-app`, `search-filter`.

3. **Big Projects**:
   - Larger projects that don't fit into the individual or feature categories reside directly in the main repository.
   - These big projects may have their own subdirectories.
   - Examples: `clone-apps`, `portfolio-website`.
